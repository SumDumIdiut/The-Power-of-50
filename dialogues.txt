Hero: I've been searching for the ancient artifact for weeks now.
Wizard: The artifact you seek lies deep within the Crystal Caverns.
Hero: Crystal Caverns? That sounds dangerous. What should I expect?
Wizard: Beware of the shadow creatures that guard the entrance.
Hero: I'll be careful. Thank you for the warning!
